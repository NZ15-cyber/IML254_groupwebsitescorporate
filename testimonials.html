    <h2>What Our Happy Clients Say</h2>
    <div class="intro-box">
      “Seeing a happy customer is the best reward for our hard work.”
    </div>

    <div class="testimonial">
      <h4>🌟 Aiman & Liyana – Alor Setar</h4>
      <p>
        “We were planning our wedding on a tight budget, but we still wanted it to feel elegant and well-fed.
        RAHMAH truly delivered — from the portion size to the polite staff. Guests kept asking who our caterer was!
        The RM18/pax package felt like RM50 service. Highly recommend.”
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="testimonial">
      <h4>🌟 Syafiqah & Faizal – Sungai Petani</h4>
      <p>
        “The food was AMAZING! Daging masak hitam was so tender, and the ayam masak merah had that perfect kick.
        But what really made a difference was how responsive and helpful the team was throughout the process.
        Even with 500 guests, everything ran smoothly.”
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="testimonial">
      <h4>🌟 Puan Zaiton – Mother of the Bride</h4>
      <p>
        “As a mother, I wanted my daughter’s day to be beautiful. RAHMAH made that possible.
        Their setup was neat, the waiters were attentive, and the food was fresh until the very end.
        I’m grateful we found such a trustworthy team with a sincere heart.”

    <div class="testimonial">
      <h4>🌟 Haziq – Wedding Guest</h4>
      <p>
        “Usually at big weddings, food runs out or it’s cold. But not with RAHMAH.
        The buffet line was clean and well-stocked, and the kambing golek was out of this world.
        I’ve been recommending them to all my friends getting married.”
      </p>
    </div>

    <div class="testimonial">
      <h4>🌟 Nadrah & Iman – Kulim</h4>
      <p>
        “We added a live teh tarik station and it was such a hit! It made the event feel even more personal and festive.
        The team coordinated everything smoothly. Plus, they listened to our ideas and worked within our RM20 budget.
        Thank you RAHMAH for being professional and kind.”
