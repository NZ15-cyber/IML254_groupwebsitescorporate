If you don’t see your question here, feel free to <a href="contact.html">contact us directly</a> — we’re happy to assist!
</p>

<h3>1. What is the price range for your catering packages?</h3>
<p>
Our packages start from RM12 per guest for the Basic Package, RM18 for Standard, and RM25 for Premium. 
We also offer custom pricing based on your event needs, guest count, and menu selection. 
There are no hidden fees — all prices include setup, staff, and serving equipment.
</p>

<h3>2. How early should I book?</h3>
<p>
We recommend booking at least 1–3 months in advance, especially for weekend weddings or during peak seasons. 
However, we do accept last-minute bookings (minimum 2 weeks notice) depending on availability.
</p>

<h3>3. Can I customize the menu?</h3>
<p>
Yes! All our menus can be tailored to your taste and preferences. 
You can mix and match dishes, request vegetarian or allergy-friendly options, or add signature family dishes. 
We’re here to make your wedding meal feel personal and meaningful.
</p>

<h3>4. Is your food 100% halal?</h3>
<p>
Absolutely. All our ingredients are sourced from halal-certified suppliers, and we follow strict hygiene and preparation practices. 
We’re committed to serving meals that all your guests can enjoy with confidence.
</p>

<h3>5. Do you provide a food tasting session?</h3>
<p>
Yes, we provide complimentary food tasting for 2 people for couples who book the Premium Package. 
For other packages, a small tasting fee may apply — which can be waived if you confirm your booking with us.
</p>

<h3>6. What’s included in the package?</h3>
<p>
All packages include food, buffet setup, serving trays or dome sets, staff, drinks, basic table skirting, and delivery within our service area. 
Higher-tier packages also include decorations, VIP tables, and additional services like live cooking stations and waiter service.
</p>

<h3>7. Can I request extra food or a second round?</h3>
<p>
Yes! We offer top-up portions or refill service depending on the package. 
Let us know in advance if you expect a larger crowd or want to provide take-home containers for guests.
</p>

<h3>8. What happens in case of cancellation?</h3>
<p>
We understand plans can change. A refund policy applies based on how early the cancellation is made. 
Generally, deposits are non-refundable but transferable to future dates (subject to availability).
</p>

<h3>9. Do you cover areas outside Kedah?</h3>
<p>
Yes, we cater to most parts of Kedah and nearby states depending on the scale of the event and package selected. 
Transport charges may apply for distant locations. Feel free to check with us!
</p>

<h3>10. How do I confirm a booking?</h3>
<p>
You can fill out our <a href="booking.html">booking form</a> or contact us directly. 
A 30% deposit is required to confirm your date, and the remaining balance is due 3–5 days before the event.
